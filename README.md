# sorting-visualizer

# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

I built this app because I'm fascinated by sorting algorithms. I've seen other apps like this, but I wanted to try my hand at building one for myself from scratch. Play with it and let me know what you think! You can see it in action at https://jonnytullis.github.io/sorting-visualizer/
